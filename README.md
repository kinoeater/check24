## CUCUMBER FRAMEWORK DESIGN
   
   
1. You can choose firefox or chrome by adding from config file. Code can be modified by the help of Bonigarciaâ€™s webdriver manager if it is required to use different browsers.  
2. Each Page Object has its specific web elements and methods in it.
3. Base Page has some specific easy to use methods. More methods can be added if required. It is like a toolbox of the framework, use the gadgets, add new gadgets when you find.
   
## REPORTING
   
 1. I used Cucumber Extent Report as reporting tool.  
 2. After each test run latest test report can be seen with "report.html" name under /output directory. 
 3. Report can be opened simply double clicking on the  item.
